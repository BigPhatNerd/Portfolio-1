            Full Stack Web Developer leveraging a psychology background and its
            concepts to create an engaging user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            After practicing psychology and bartending, I realized I wanted a
            new challenge. I earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from
            the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill where I advanced my
            skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript. In addition to these skills I also
            taught myself Swift and Python to help round out my skill sets.
          </p>
          <p>
            From earning a management position in highschool, to working two
            jobs to support myself through college, and now pivoting into the
            tech industry, I am constantly looking for a new way to challenge
            and improve myself. I have great time management skills, a tireless
            work ethic, and I crave a challenging workplace and an environment
            that fosters growth. It is these skills that have helped me become a
            software developer, and helped me master the skills taught in my
            certificate program. It is often my strong sense of leadership,
            can-do attitude and unyielding work ethic that leads me to
            leadership positions. I thrive on leading those around me to
            accomplishing our goals. Check out some of

          <p>Below are some of the projects I'm most proud of. A link to each repo is provided.</p>
          <h3>Employee Management System 
            <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/jamespericles/Employee-Management-System"
            class="icon brands fa-github"
            >
            <span class="label">GitHub</span>
          </a>
        </h3>      
          <span class="image main"><img src="images/start_screen.png" alt="Employee Management Start Screen" /></span>
          <p>
            The Employee Management System is a CLI project that utilizes Node.js, Javascript, and MySQL to create a robust application to manage a populate of employees. 
            It offers several different functions, including the ability to not only create employees, roles, and departments, but also manipulate them after their creation. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I am very proud of this project, particularly the way I made it so that existing data can be retrieved and presented as choices where appropriate. This required me to nest several queries within one another.
            This project also taught me how to rebase a repository!
          </p>
          <h3>Random Password Generator 
            <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/jamespericles/Random-Password-Generator"
            class="icon brands fa-github"
            >
            <span class="label">GitHub</span>
          </a>
        </h3>      
          <span class="image main"><img src="images/Password_Generator.png" alt="Password Generator Site" /></span>
          <p>
            Choosing from four different groups of characters, users are able to create a password ranging from 8-128 characters in length. Besides displaying the generated password, the user may also copy them directly to their clipboard.
          </p>
          <p>
           This project comes in two flavors! I was expected to build it using Javascript and basic HTML early on in my Bootcamp. Over a long weekend, I taught myself Xcode and Swift by recreating this project. The repository for the Swift version of this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/jamespericles/Swift-Password-Generator">here.</a>
